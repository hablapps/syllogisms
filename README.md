## Aristotelian syllogisms in Scala 3

This repository aims at explaining some features of the Scala 3 type system using Aristotelian syllogisms.
In particular, it shows how signatures built upon traits, algebraic data types and dependent types allow us to model 
these logical arguments, and how type-driven development mimics the logical reasoning behind their 
corresponding proofs.
